## Introduction to Multilingual support in applications

__I18n__ stands for _internationalization_. It's the process of designing and developing software or products so they can be easily adapted for different languages and regions.  

Think of it as making your product ready to be used all over the world.   
This involves more than just translation (which is part of a related process called localization).   

Here's a breakdown:  

- Internationalization (i18n) lays the groundwork.   
It ensures the code can handle:   
	- Different languages 
	- Character sets
	- Date and time formats  
	- Currencies, etc.  

- Localization (l10n) builds on that foundation.   
It tailors the software to a specific region or culture, including:   
	- Translating text  
	- Adapting images and layouts and  
	- Using culturally appropriate references.  

So, __i18n__ is like setting the stage for a play that can be performed anywhere in the world, while __l10n__ is like translating the script and adjusting the set design for a particular audience.
