# 0x00. Pagination

## Definition
__Pagination__, also sometimes called paging, refers to the method of dividing  
a large set of data (like search results, product listings, or blog posts)   
into manageable chunks and displaying them across multiple pages.

### Here's how it works:  

__Data is divided:__
- A large dataset is split into smaller subsets based on a chosen number of items per page (often called the page size).  
__Pages are created:__   
- Each subset becomes its own separate page, typically numbered sequentially.  
__Navigation is provided:__   
Users can navigate between pages using controls like page numbers or "Next" and "Previous" buttons.   
This allows them to find and access specific portions of the data set efficiently.

### Benefits of pagination:  
__Improved performance:__   
- By loading data in smaller chunks, pagination helps websites render pages faster, especially for datasets with many entries.
__Enhanced user experience:__   
- Large amounts of information on a single page can be overwhelming.   
- Pagination makes it easier for users to browse and digest information in smaller, more manageable sections.  
__Better accessibility:__   
- Pagination aids users with screen readers or assistive technologies by allowing them to navigate through content in smaller parts.
